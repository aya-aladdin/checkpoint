        question: "Is there a cost to participate?",
        answer: "No, CheckPoint is absolutely FREE for all participants! We believe in making technology accessible to everyone, so the full experience — including workshops, mentorship, and swag — comes at no cost, thanks to our amazing sponsors.

We also encourage you to hop into our Discord server to meet fellow hackers, ask questions, and stay in the loop!"

    {
        question: "What kind of projects can I build?",
        answer: "You can build anything you can imagine — as long as it's based on the theme: gamified productivity and street culture. Whether it's a web app, mobile app, AI model, or hardware hack, your project should creatively incorporate those two keywords in any way you interpret them - be creative and twist the words. Take the theme, run with it, and make something totally unique!"
