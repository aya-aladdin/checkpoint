We believe in making technology accessible to everyone, so the full experience — including workshops, mentorship, and swag — comes at no cost, thanks to our amazing sponsors.

                <p> You can build anything you can imagine — as long as it’s based on the theme: gamified productivity and street culture. Whether it’s a web app, mobile app, AI model, or hardware hack, your project should creatively incorporate those two keywords in any way you interpret them. Take the theme, run with it, and make something totally unique!</p>
